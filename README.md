# GoGoLoco Modular Avatar

This repo gives you acccess to a package to integrate GoGoLoco as a Modular Avatar Prefab.

Modular Avatar will be loaded as a VPM dependency.

If you don't have it yet, add is as a vpm list here : <https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev>

## GoGoLoCo Internals

As for now, GoGoLoco doesn't support the VCC Format, so it is required that you install it in your project for the prefabs to work.
Muy be fixed in the future.

## GoGoLoco All

Use the GoGoLoco_All_MA prefab to have the "ALL" features, including all gogoloco animations.

## GoGoLoco Beyond

Use the GoGoLoco_Beyond_MA prefab to have the "Beyond" features, including the "ALL" package + the flying features.
