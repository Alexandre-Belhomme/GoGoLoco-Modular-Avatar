# GoGoLoco Modular Avatar

This are prefabs allowing the use of Modular Avatar as an alternative as VRCFury.
They are placed in the "Prefabs" folder.

## GoGoLoCo Internals

As for now, GoGoLoco doesn't support the VCC Format, so it is required that you install it in your project for the prefabs to work.
Muy be fixed in the future.

## GoGoLoco All

Use the GoGoLoco_All_MA prefab to have the "ALL" features, including all gogoloco animations.

## GoGoLoco Beyond
